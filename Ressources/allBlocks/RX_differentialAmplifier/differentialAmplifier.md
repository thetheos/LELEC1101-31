### The differential amplifier
---
The differential amplifier simply multiplies and then subtracts two signals. Refering to the schematic `differentialAmplifier.asc`, we get 
\[
 V_{out} = - \frac{R_2}{R_1} V_{in_1} + \frac{R_2}{R_1} V_{in_2}
\]
In itself, the differential amplifier has very few *limits*.
